# Shame

If you write a rule that should not be written, a work-around for non-compliant
browser behavior, a fix the standard should be fixing itself, a hack that makes
you ashamed of yourself as you're writing it... That rule belongs here.

Hopefully the rules written here will be temporary (for some definition of
"temporary"), and browsers and the CSS standard will eventually be robust enough
that we don't need to be ashamed of ourselves. Until then, we should sequester
the worst of our rules somewhere s.t. we know what should be fixed first.

This is not part of the 7-1 architecture, and so has no reference.
